# Snap Shot App

This is a simple gallery project where we can search the photos by keywords &amp; changing the category based on clicks of Mountain, Beaches, Birds, Food. Once we hover on the images, we will get the zoom-in images. Here I used React hooks, Context API and React Router to complete this project. The Routes have four default pages and a search page.
